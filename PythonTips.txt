#Arithemtic Operators
+	#addition
- 	#subtraction
*	#multiplication
/	#division
%	#modulo - remainder
**	#exponentiation
//	#integer division - quotient
^	#bitwise XOR (usually outside scope)

=	#assignment operator

x, y, z = 2, 3, 5 #carries out sequential assignment, i.e., x=2, y =3, z=5

snake_case #Python's Preferred Naming Convention

+=	#Python's way of assigning a variable with itself

e.g., x += 2 same as x = x + 2, or x -= 2 same as x = x - 2, x *= 0.9 same as x = 0.9*x

type()	#checks type of object

#Data Types
int	#integer. whole numbers
float	#floats, all decimals and fractions
		##it's important to note that fractions are stored as approximations in Python (base 2 limitations)
bool #Boolean logic, data types with true or false
string


#Comparison Operators
<	#Less than
>	#Greater than
<=	#Less than or equal to
>=	#Greater than or equal to
==	#is equal to, checks if two variables are equal
!=	#is not equal to, checks if two variables are NOT equal

Logical Operators
and #checks boolean values of two statements, TRUE and TRUE shows TRUE, TRUE and FALSE shows FALSE, FALSE and FALSE sho
or
not

\ backslash allows python to skip quotation marks
